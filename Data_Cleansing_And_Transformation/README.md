## Data cleansing proces:
    involves in identifying and correcting or removing errors, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies in datasets to improve their quality and reliability.
## Data transformation:
    is the process of converting data from one format or structure into another. This is often necessary when moving data between systems that use different data formats, or when preparing data for analysis. Common data transformation operations include normalization, aggregation, and generalization. 
## The importance of accuracy and consistency
    1): Data accuracy refers to how close your data values are to the actual or true value.
    2): Data consistency ensures that data across all platforms and systems in an organization presents a unified and coherent view of the data. 
## Data Quality Problems:
    a): Inconsistent Data
    b): Missing Data
    c): Incorrect Data
    d): Inacurrate Data

## Understanding the downstream applications of your data
    step 1: data discovery and interpertation:
        All fields required in the output data need to be mapped from attributes of the input data, and each layer of data processing should be designed to perform a specific set of tasks that produce a known output data requirement.
    step 2: checking for missing or invalid data:
        a): dropping columns with all null values
        b): dropping rows with too many missing values
        c): working with missing data
        d): merging datasets and data aggregation
    step 3: data mapping with target data:
    step 4: creating the transformation activity
    step 5: running the workflow
    step 6: post-transformation check
